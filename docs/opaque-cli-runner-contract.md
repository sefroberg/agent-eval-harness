# Opaque CLI Runner Contract

The opaque CLI runner (`runner.type: cli`) delegates execution to an arbitrary
command. This document defines the contract between the harness and the external
command so that downstream features (judges, scoring, reporting, regression
detection, MLflow) work correctly.

## Placeholders

The command template receives these placeholders, resolved before execution:

| Placeholder | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `{agent}` | Skill name or agent definition path | `run_skill(skill_name=...)` |
| `{workspace}` | Absolute path to the case workspace | Created by `workspace.py` |
| `{output_dir}` | Absolute path to `{workspace}/output` | Created by the opaque CLI runner |
| `{model}` | Model identifier (e.g. `sonnet`, `gpt-4`) | `--model` CLI flag or `models.skill` |
| `{subagent_model}` | Subagent model identifier (empty if unset) | `models.subagent` or `--subagent-model` |
| `{timeout}` | Timeout in seconds (string) | `execution.timeout` or harness default |
| `{max_budget_usd}` | Budget cap (string) | `execution.max_budget_usd` or harness default |
| `{effort}` | Reasoning effort level (empty if unset) | `runner.effort` or `--effort` |
| `{system_prompt}` | System prompt text (empty if unset) | `runner.system_prompt` |
| `{args}` | Resolved skill arguments | `execution.arguments` with `{field}` substitution |
| `{field}` | Any field from `input.yaml` | Case-specific; does not override builtins above |

## Contract: what the command MUST do

| Requirement | Why | What breaks without it |
|---|---|---|
| Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure | Exit code drives pass/fail status in scoring and reporting. `-1` means timeout. | Cases always show as FAIL; worst-exit-code aggregation inflates failure counts |
| Write artifact files to `{output_dir}` or to the paths declared in `outputs[*].path` | `collect.py` scans these paths to gather artifacts for judges | Judges receive an empty `files` dict; all file-based checks fail |
| Finish before `{timeout}` seconds | The harness kills the process at the deadline via `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` | Process is killed; result recorded as exit `-1` with "Timed out" stderr |

## Contract: what the command SHOULD do

| Recommendation | Why | What degrades without it |
|---|---|---|
| Use `{model}` for model selection | The harness resolves `--model` / `models.skill` into this placeholder; it's the user's chosen model for this eval | Command uses its own default; eval results don't reflect the model the user asked for |
| Use `{subagent_model}` for subagents | Resolved from `models.subagent`; controls delegation model in multi-agent setups | Subagents use wrong model; cost/quality mismatch vs what user configured |
| Honor `{max_budget_usd}` | The harness passes this as a hint but **cannot enforce it** for opaque CLI runners | Command may overspend; no server-side guardrail like Claude Code's `--max-budget-usd` |
| Use `{effort}` for reasoning effort | Resolved from `runner.effort` / `--effort`; controls quality-vs-speed tradeoff | Command ignores effort setting; eval doesn't test the intended effort level |
| Use `{system_prompt}` if applicable | Resolved from `runner.system_prompt`; provides behavioral context to the agent | Agent runs without the system prompt the eval was designed to test |
| Write `{output_dir}/metrics.json` | Only way the harness gets token/cost data from an opaque CLI runner | `token_usage`, `cost_usd`, `num_turns` all report as `None`; cost tables empty in reports; no budget tracking |
| Write output to stdout | `execute.py` captures stdout to `stdout.log`; judges can access it via `outputs["stdout"]` | Judges that inspect stdout (e.g. checking for specific output text) see empty string |
| Write errors to stderr | Captured to `stderr.log`; shown in HTML report for failed cases | Failures lack diagnostic context in reports |
| Run in `{workspace}` as cwd | The harness sets `cwd` to workspace, but the command can change it; input.yaml and symlinked resources are there | Command can't find input files or project resources |

## metrics.json format

Write to `{output_dir}/metrics.json`. All fields are optional:

```json
{
  "token_usage": {"input": 1500, "output": 800},
  "cost_usd": 0.03,
  "num_turns": 4,
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "models_used": ["claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"],
  "per_model_usage": {
    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {"input": 1200, "output": 600, "cost_usd": 0.025},
    "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001": {"input": 300, "output": 200, "cost_usd": 0.005}
  },
  "per_model_turns": {
    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": 3,
    "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001": 1
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `token_usage` | `{input: int, output: int}` | Report token breakdown; MLflow metrics; cost-per-turn calculation |
| `cost_usd` | `float` | Report cost column; MLflow run metric; regression cost comparison |
| `num_turns` | `int` | Report turn count; cost-per-turn ratio |
| `model` | `str` | Report model column; MLflow run parameter; `resolved_model` in RunResult |
| `models_used` | `list[str]` | Subagent model detection in reports |
| `per_model_usage` | `{model: {input, output, cost_usd}}` | Per-model cost breakdown in reports and MLflow |
| `per_model_turns` | `{model: int}` | Per-model turn breakdown in reports |

## What the harness provides in the workspace

Before the command runs, the workspace contains:

| Path | Description | Relevant to opaque CLI runner? |
|---|---|---|
| `input.yaml` | Case input data (fields available as `{field}` placeholders) | Yes — primary input |
| `output/` | Pre-created output directory (`{output_dir}`) | Yes — write artifacts here |
| Output dirs from `outputs[*].path` | Pre-created directories matching eval.yaml | Yes — alternative artifact locations |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Permissions, hooks, env vars | No — Claude Code specific |
| `.claude/hooks/tools.py` | Tool interception script | No — Claude Code specific |
| `subagents/` | Subagent transcript capture dir | No — Claude Code specific |
| Symlinks to `scripts/`, `skills/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.context/` | Project resources | Maybe — depends on the external command |

## What the harness reads after execution

| Source | Collected by | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| Process stdout | `execute.py` → `stdout.log` | Judges (via `outputs["stdout"]`); tool call extraction; MLflow trace builder |
| Process stderr | `execute.py` → `stderr.log` | Judges (via `outputs["stderr"]`); HTML report error display |
| Process exit code | `execute.py` → `run_result.json` | Report pass/fail; worst-exit aggregation; MLflow metric |
| Files in `outputs[*].path` dirs | `collect.py` → `cases/{id}/{path}/` | Judges (via `outputs["files"]`); convenience keys like `outputs["{dirname}_content"]` |
| Files modified in-place in workspace | `collect.py` via `git diff` | Judges (via `outputs["modified_files"]`) |
| `{output_dir}/metrics.json` | `cli_runner.py` → RunResult fields | Report metrics; MLflow logging; regression comparison |

## What judges receive

Judges get an `outputs` dict with these keys (all populated from the above sources):

| Key | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `files` | `{relative_path: content_str}` | Collected artifacts from output dirs |
| `modified_files` | `{relative_path: content_str}` | In-place edits detected by git diff |
| `{dirname}_content` | `str` | First file's content from each output dir (convenience) |
| `{dirname}_file` | `str` | Absolute path to that file |
| `stdout` | `str` | stdout.log (if `traces.stdout` enabled) |
| `stderr` | `str` | stderr.log (if `traces.stderr` enabled) |
| `exit_code` | `int` | From run_result.json (if `traces.metrics` enabled) |
| `duration_s` | `float` | From run_result.json |
| `token_usage` | `dict` | From run_result.json (originally from metrics.json) |
| `cost_usd` | `float` | From run_result.json |
| `num_turns` | `int` | From run_result.json |
| `annotations` | `dict` | From dataset `annotations.yaml` (not runner-produced) |
| `case_dir` | `str` | Absolute path to collected case output |
| `input_path` | `str` | Path to input.yaml in case output dir |

## Environment

| Behavior | Opaque CLI runner | Claude Code runner |
|---|---|---|
| Inherits caller's env | Full `os.environ` (see security note below) | Filtered to safe allowlist |
| `execution.env` vars | Injected via `_build_env()` with `$VAR` resolution | Injected into `.claude/settings.json` env block |
| `runner.env` | No effect (full env already inherited) | Injects explicit key/value pairs on top of safe allowlist (`$VAR` resolved from caller) |

**Security note on environment inheritance:** The opaque CLI runner inherits the
full caller environment because commands are provided by the eval author (not
untrusted input). The Claude Code runner uses a strict allowlist because it
executes arbitrary agent-generated tool calls. Use `runner.env` to forward
additional env vars (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`) beyond the built-in defaults.

## Features that don't work with the opaque CLI runner

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| Budget enforcement | Harness can't throttle an opaque process; `{max_budget_usd}` is advisory |
| Tool interception / AskUserQuestion answering | Requires Claude Code PreToolUse hooks |
| Stream-json trace building | Requires Claude Code `--output-format stream-json` |
| Subagent transcript capture | Requires Claude Code SubagentStop hook |
| Permission denial detection | Requires Claude Code stream-json events |
| Real-time progress logging | Requires stream-json event parsing |
