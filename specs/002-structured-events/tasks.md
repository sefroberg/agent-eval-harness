# Tasks: Structured Event Stream for Judges

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/002-structured-events/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: Included (the eval harness has existing test infrastructure in `tests/`).

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: No project initialization needed. Feature addition to existing codebase.

(No setup tasks required.)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Shared Parser Module)

**Purpose**: Create the shared event parser that all user stories depend on.

- [X] T001 Create `agent_eval/events.py` with `parse_stream_events(stdout_text, result_cap=50000)` function that parses JSONL into structured event dicts per the data model schema (includes subagent events with `parent_tool_use_id` and `agent_id` tags)
- [X] T002 [P] Add `event_result_cap` field to `TracesConfig` in `agent_eval/config.py` (default: 50000) and update `traces.events` default to `true`
- [X] T003 [P] Unit tests for `parse_stream_events()` in `tests/test_events.py`: valid JSONL with assistant text, tool calls, tool results, system/result events, timestamps, subagent events with tags

**Checkpoint**: Shared parser exists, is tested, and can convert JSONL stdout into structured events including subagent events.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Evaluate skill output through structured events (Priority: P1) MVP

**Goal**: Judges access pre-parsed structured events via `outputs["events"]` instead of raw JSONL.

**Independent Test**: Configure a check judge accessing `outputs["events"]`, run scoring against a case with JSONL stdout, verify events list contains expected tool calls and assistant text.

### Tests for User Story 1

- [X] T004 [P] [US1] Unit test for events.json generation in `tests/test_events.py`: verify `collect.py` integration writes correct events.json from JSONL stdout
- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Unit test for `load_case_record()` loading events from events.json in `tests/test_events.py`: verify `record["events"]` populated, `record["stdout"]` absent

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T006 [US1] Modify `skills/eval-run/scripts/collect.py` to call `parse_stream_events()` on `stdout.log` and write `events.json` per case using atomic writes (temp file + rename), gated by `traces.events` config
- [X] T007 [US1] Modify `load_case_record()` in `skills/eval-run/scripts/score.py` to load `events.json` into `record["events"]` (with schema validation: fall back to `[]` with stderr warning if missing or malformed) and remove `record["stdout"]` loading
- [X] T008 [US1] Replace `_extract_tool_calls()` in `skills/eval-run/scripts/score.py` with a lookup over `record["events"]` (filter for tool_use blocks in assistant events)
- [X] T009 [US1] Remove `_extract_assistant_text()` from `skills/eval-run/scripts/score.py` (will be replaced by `{{ conversation }}` in US2)

**Checkpoint**: `outputs["events"]` works for check judges. `outputs["stdout"]` no longer present in record. Tool calls derived from events.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Render conversation text in LLM judge prompts (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: LLM judges use `{{ conversation }}` to include assistant text from events.

**Independent Test**: Configure an LLM judge with `{{ conversation }}`, run scoring, verify rendered prompt contains assistant text from events.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [X] T010 [P] [US2] Unit test for `{{ conversation }}` rendering in `tests/test_events.py`: verify template variable replaced with concatenated root-level assistant text from events (no subagent text)

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T012 [US2] Add `{{ conversation }}` rendering block in `_make_anthropic_llm_judge()` in `skills/eval-run/scripts/score.py` (extract root-level assistant text from `record["events"]`, filter out subagent events, concatenate)

**Checkpoint**: `{{ conversation }}` works for LLM judges, rendering root-only text.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Evaluate skill process quality (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Check judges can inspect tool call sequences, counts, and patterns via `outputs["events"]`.

**Independent Test**: Configure a check judge that verifies tool call ordering (Read before Write) by iterating `outputs["events"]`.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [X] T014 [P] [US3] Unit test for process quality judge pattern in `tests/test_events.py`: verify iterating events gives correct tool call sequence with names and inputs

### Implementation for User Story 3

(No additional implementation needed. US1 already provides `outputs["events"]` with tool calls. This phase validates that the event structure supports process quality patterns via tests.)

**Checkpoint**: Process quality judge pattern verified. Events contain sufficient data for tool sequence, retry count, and behavioral analysis.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Evaluate subagent behavior (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Judges can identify and evaluate subagent events within the flat event list using `parent_tool_use_id` and `agent_id` tags.

**Independent Test**: Configure a check judge that filters `outputs["events"]` by `parent_tool_use_id` to separate root from subagent events. Run against a case with subagent activity. Verify correct separation.

### Tests for User Story 4

- [X] T015 [P] [US4] Unit test for subagent event tagging in `tests/test_events.py`: verify events from stdout with `parent_tool_use_id` carry both `parent_tool_use_id` and `agent_id` in parsed events
- [X] T016 [P] [US4] Unit test for transcript merging in `tests/test_events.py`: verify `subagents/*.jsonl` transcript events are merged into the event list with proper `agent_id`, deduplicated against already-streamed events by message ID
- [X] T017 [P] [US4] Unit test for root-only filtering in `tests/test_events.py`: verify filtering events by `not e.get("parent_tool_use_id")` yields only root events

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T018 [US4] Add `merge_subagent_transcripts(events, subagent_dir)` function to `agent_eval/events.py` that reads `subagents/*.jsonl`, converts to event dicts with `agent_id`, deduplicates by message ID against existing events, and inserts in chronological order
- [X] T019 [US4] Modify `skills/eval-run/scripts/collect.py` to call `merge_subagent_transcripts()` after `parse_stream_events()`, passing the case's subagent directory

**Checkpoint**: Judges can distinguish root from subagent events. Transcript events merged without duplicates.

---

## Phase 7: Edge Cases

**Purpose**: Verify graceful handling of edge cases identified in the spec.

- [X] T020 [P] Unit test for empty/missing stdout.log in `tests/test_events.py`: verify `parse_stream_events("")` returns `[]`
- [X] T021 [P] Unit test for non-JSONL content in `tests/test_events.py`: verify plain text lines are skipped, returns `[]`
- [X] T022 [P] Unit test for tool result exceeding 50K cap in `tests/test_events.py`: verify content truncated with `"[truncated]"` marker, `truncated: true` and `original_length` metadata present
- [X] T023 [P] Unit test for `traces.events: false` in `tests/test_events.py`: verify no `events.json` written, `record["events"]` is `[]`
- [X] T024 [P] Unit test for subagent deduplication in `tests/test_events.py`: verify events streamed in stdout and also in transcript are not double-counted
- [X] T025 [P] Unit test for non-UTF-8 tool result content in `tests/test_events.py`: verify binary content replaced with `"(binary content, N bytes)"` placeholder
- [X] T026 [P] Unit test for malformed events.json loading in `tests/test_events.py`: verify `load_case_record()` returns `record["events"] = []` with warning when events.json is corrupt
- [X] T027 [P] Benchmark test for parse_stream_events() in `tests/test_events.py`: verify linear scaling with representative JSONL sizes (1KB, 100KB, 1MB)

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Documentation updates and regression check.

- [X] T028 Run existing test suite (`python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`) to verify no regressions
- [X] T029 [P] Update `skills/eval-run/references/data-pipeline.md`: document `record["events"]`, `{{ conversation }}`, subagent event tags, add events.json to pipeline flow
- [X] T030 [P] Update `skills/eval-analyze/references/eval-yaml-template.md`: add `{{ conversation }}` to examples, add `traces.events` and `traces.event_result_cap` documentation
- [X] T031 [P] Update `skills/eval-analyze/prompts/analyze-skill.md`: add `{{ conversation }}` template variable guidance

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: No dependencies, start immediately
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on T001 (parser) and T002 (config)
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 (events loaded into record)
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 (events available)
- **US4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 (events available) and T001 (parser handles subagent tags)
- **Edge Cases (Phase 7)**: Depends on T001 (parser) and T018 (transcript merger)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Depends on foundational parser. Core implementation.
- **US2 (P2)**: Depends on US1. Template variable rendering.
- **US3 (P3)**: Depends on US1. Test-only verification.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T002 and T003 can run in parallel (different files)
- T004 and T005 can run in parallel (different test functions)
- T010 and T011 can run in parallel (different test functions)
- T015, T016, T017 can all run in parallel (independent test functions)
- T020-T024 can all run in parallel (independent edge case tests)
- T026-T028 can all run in parallel (different documentation files)
- US3 and US4 can overlap after US1 (independent user stories)
