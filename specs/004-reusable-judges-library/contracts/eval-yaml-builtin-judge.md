# Contract: Builtin Judge in eval.yaml

## eval.yaml Schema Extension

```yaml
judges:
  - name: <user_defined_name>         # Required: user-defined identifier for thresholds/reports
    builtin: <builtin_judge_name>     # Required: flat name or FQN (e.g., safety/no_harmful_content)
    description: <string>             # Optional: overrides the judge's default description
    if: <python_expr>                 # Optional: skip judge if expression returns False
    model: <model_id>                 # Optional: override models.judge for LLM judges
    arguments:                        # Optional: passed as **kwargs (Python) or Jinja var (LLM)
      <key>: <value>
```

**Trust boundary**: `eval.yaml` is a repository-controlled, trusted configuration file. The `if` field is evaluated using `eval(expr, {"__builtins__": {}}, {"annotations": ..., "outputs": ...})`, which disables all Python builtins. Only the `annotations` and `outputs` dicts are available as local variables. No builtin functions (`len`, `str`, `int`, etc.) are accessible. This is an existing behavior shared with all judge types. Do not accept eval.yaml from untrusted sources.

## Examples

### Minimal builtin (LLM)
```yaml
judges:
  - name: safety_check
    builtin: no_harmful_content
```

### Python builtin with arguments
```yaml
judges:
  - name: budget_check
    builtin: cost_budget
    arguments:
      max_cost_usd: 0.50
```

### LLM builtin with model override (FQN reference)
```yaml
judges:
  - name: completeness
    builtin: quality/output_completeness
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    arguments:
      strictness: high
```

### With condition
```yaml
judges:
  - name: tool_validation
    builtin: tool_call_validation
    if: "outputs.get('tool_calls', [])"
```

### Mixed with other judge types (arguments works everywhere)
```yaml
judges:
  - name: safety_check
    builtin: no_harmful_content

  - name: has_output
    check: |
      content = outputs.get("main_content", "")
      return (len(content) > 0, f"Content length: {len(content)}")

  - name: quality
    prompt_file: judges/quality.md
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    arguments:
      focus: completeness

  - name: custom_code
    module: eval.judges.custom
    function: judge
    arguments:
      threshold: 0.8

thresholds:
  safety_check:
    min_pass_rate: 1.0
  quality:
    min_mean: 3.5
```

## Python Judge Function Contract

```python
def judge(outputs: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[bool | int | float, str]:
    """
    Args:
        outputs: Case record dict containing files, tool_calls, events,
                 annotations, execution metrics, and conversation text.
        **kwargs: Values from the `arguments` dict in eval.yaml.
                  Empty if no arguments specified.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (value, rationale: str).
        - value: bool (pass/fail), int (1-5 score), or float
        - rationale: Human-readable explanation of the result
    """
```

This contract applies uniformly to:
- Builtin Python judges (`.py` files in `agent_eval/judges/`)
- External code judges (`module`/`function`)
- Backward-compatible: existing judges accepting only `(outputs)` continue to work when `arguments` is empty

## LLM Judge Prompt Contract

LLM judge files are Jinja2 templates (`.md`) with these variables available:

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `outputs` | dict | Full case record (same as Python judge `outputs` argument) |
| `arguments` | dict | Values from `arguments` in eval.yaml (empty dict if not specified) |

Additional top-level template variables:
- `annotations`: pre-rendered annotation text (formatted key-value pairs)
- `conversation`: root-level assistant text extracted from events

This contract applies uniformly to ALL LLM judges:
- Builtin LLM judges (`.md` files in `agent_eval/judges/`)
- Inline LLM judges (`prompt` or `prompt_file`)

All LLM judges use Jinja2 for template rendering, regardless of whether `arguments` is specified.

**Required output format**: Depends on `feedback_type`. Default for `prompt`/`prompt_file` judges: `{"score": int 1-5, "rationale": str}`. For builtin LLM judges or `feedback_type: bool`: `{"passed": bool, "rationale": str}`.

**Available Jinja filters**: Standard Jinja2 filters plus `tojson` for serializing dicts.

## Arguments for Inline Check Judges

For `check` judges, `arguments` values are available as local variables in the check snippet:

```yaml
judges:
  - name: size_check
    check: |
      content = outputs.get("main_content", "")
      limit = arguments.get("max_chars", 10000)
      return (len(content) <= limit, f"Content length: {len(content)}/{limit}")
    arguments:
      max_chars: 5000
```

The `arguments` dict is injected into the eval locals alongside `outputs` and `annotations`.

## Vendoring

To customize a builtin judge, copy the file and reference it using the appropriate field:

```yaml
# Vendored Python judge (was: builtin: cost_budget)
judges:
  - name: custom_budget
    module: eval.judges.cost_budget
    function: judge
    arguments:
      max_cost_usd: 2.00

# Vendored LLM judge (was: builtin: output_completeness)
judges:
  - name: custom_completeness
    prompt_file: eval/judges/output_completeness.md
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    arguments:
      strictness: low
```

## Error Conditions

| Condition | Error Message Pattern |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Unknown builtin name | `Unknown builtin judge '{name}'. Available: {sorted_names}` |
| Duplicate judge name | `Duplicate judge name '{name}' in eval.yaml` |
| Name collision across categories | `Builtin judge name collision: '{name}' found in both {cat1}/ and {cat2}/` |
| Mutually exclusive fields | `Judge '{name}': 'builtin' is mutually exclusive with {conflicting_fields}` (where `{conflicting_fields}` lists only the fields actually set) |
