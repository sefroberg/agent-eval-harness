# eval.yaml Template

Use this template when generating eval.yaml. Fill in every field from what you observed in the skill analysis and dataset exploration — never use placeholder text.

## Full Structure

```yaml
name: <project-name>
description: <one line: what is being evaluated>
skill: <skill-name>

# Execution — how the skill processes test cases (runner-agnostic)
#
# How to choose the mode — look at the skill's INTERNAL LOGIC:
#
# - batch: the skill is designed to process MULTIPLE items per invocation.
#   Look at the skill's pipeline, not just its CLI flags. Signals:
#   - It iterates over a collection of inputs (batch files, ID lists, arrays)
#   - It has batch-size, parallelism, or concurrency controls
#   - It launches multiple agents or sub-skills for different items
#   - It aggregates results across items (summary tables, index files)
#   - Its pipeline phases operate on a SET of items, not one
#   A skill that supports both single and multi-item invocation is batch
#   if its primary design processes collections.
#   Examples: /rfe.speedrun (batch-creates, reviews, submits sets of RFEs),
#             /rfe.auto-fix (processes N IDs with --batch-size)
#
# - case: the skill is fundamentally designed to process ONE input per run.
#   No internal iteration, no batch controls, no multi-item aggregation.
#   Examples: /test-plan.create RHAISTRAT-1520, /rfe.create "problem..."
#
# When in doubt, ask the user — don't silently default to case.
execution:
  mode: case
  arguments: <argument template with {field} placeholders from input.yaml>
  # Case examples: "{prompt}", "{strat_key} {adr_file?}"
  # Batch example: "--input batch.yaml --headless --dry-run"
  # timeout: 3600           # Per-invocation wall-clock timeout (seconds)
  # max_budget_usd: 5.0     # Per-invocation cost cap
  # env:                     # Inject env vars into workspace .claude/settings.json
  #   JIRA_SERVER: http://localhost:8080   # Literal value
  #   JIRA_TOKEN: $JIRA_TOKEN              # $VAR resolved from caller's environment

# Runner — agent harness + runner-specific knobs
runner:
  type: claude-code         # Discriminator: claude-code, opencode, etc.
  # settings: {}            # Runner-specific settings overrides
  # plugin_dirs: []         # Plugin dirs the evaluated skill needs
  # env_strip: [JIRA_TOKEN] # Env vars to remove before launching the runner
  # system_prompt: ""       # Appended to harness system prompt
  # effort: high            # Claude Code reasoning effort: low | medium | high | xhigh | max

# Models — defaults for each role (CLI flags override)
models:
  skill: claude-opus-4-6         # Default for eval runs (or pass --model)
  # subagent: claude-sonnet-4-6  # Defaults to skill model
  judge: claude-opus-4-6         # LLM and pairwise judges need a strong model
  # hook: claude-sonnet-4-6      # For AskUserQuestion answering (fast, cheaper than Opus)

# Permissions for headless execution
# The Skill tool requires explicit permission in --print mode.
# If the skill under test invokes sub-skills via the Skill tool
# (check its allowed-tools frontmatter for "Skill"), add "Skill"
# to the allow list — otherwise nested skill calls silently fail.
permissions:
  allow: []     # Tool patterns to allow (e.g., "Skill", "Write(artifacts/**)")
  deny: []      # Tool patterns to block (e.g., "mcp__*")

# MLflow logging target (optional)
mlflow:
  experiment: <project>-eval
  # tracking_uri: sqlite:///mlflow.db   # Override env var for self-contained runs
  # tags: { team: ml }

# Dataset — describe what you actually observed in the sample case
dataset:
  path: <path to cases directory>
  schema: |
    <natural language description of each case's structure>

# Inputs — tool interception for headless execution
#
# The `match` field is NATURAL LANGUAGE — not a regex or glob. At workspace
# setup time (before execution), eval-run's LLM agent reads these descriptions
# and compiles them into concrete tool patterns, env checks, and input filters
# in tool_handlers.yaml. At runtime, tools.py uses those compiled patterns.
#
# The `prompt` field has two roles:
# - For AskUserQuestion: used at RUNTIME by the hook LLM to pick answers
# - For other tools: used at DESIGN-TIME to generate env_checks/input_filters
#
# AskUserQuestion answering uses 3-tier resolution:
#   1. Exact match from case_overrides (set in tool_handlers.yaml by eval-run)
#   2. LLM call (models.hook) using the handler prompt + case context
#      (input.yaml and answers.yaml from the case directory)
#   3. Fallback: pick the first option or "yes"
#
# For skills with interactive decisions (e.g., duplicate detection
# confirmation), provide per-case answers.yaml files in the dataset
# with guidance the LLM answerer can use.
inputs:
  tools:
    # Auto-answer user questions
    # - match: Questions asked to the user via AskUserQuestion.
    #   prompt: |
    #     Answer based on the test case context in input.yaml and answers.yaml.
    #     Use answers.yaml guidance for domain-specific decisions.
    #     Default: pick the first option or answer "yes" for confirmations.

    # Control external service access (MCP tools AND scripts)
    # - match: |
    #     Any interaction with Jira — whether via MCP tools
    #     or Bash scripts calling the Jira API.
    #   prompt: |
    #     Only allow if targeting a test instance or emulator.

# Outputs — what the skill produces (files on disk or tool calls)
outputs:
  # File artifacts on disk
  - path: <output directory>
    schema: |
      <natural language description of artifacts in this directory>
    # batch_pattern: "PREFIX-{n:03d}"
    # Batch collection: maps output files to cases when the skill processes
    # all cases in one invocation. {n} is a 1-based case index expanded to
    # match output file prefixes (e.g., "RFE-{n:03d}" → "RFE-001", "RFE-002").
    # Files whose name starts with the expanded prefix are assigned to that case.
    # Use "*" for shared directories — content is copied to every case.
    # If omitted, the collector auto-detects by common prefix patterns.

  # Tool call outputs (for side effects like API calls)
  # - tool: <tool_name_pattern>
  #   schema: |
  #     <what this tool call represents and what fields matter>

# Traces — execution data to capture for judges
traces:
  stdout: true     # Capture stdout.log
  stderr: true     # Capture stderr.log
  events: false    # Execution events: tool calls, reasoning, results (verbose)
  metrics: true    # Capture exit code, tokens, cost, duration

```

## Writing Good Schema Descriptions

The `dataset.schema` and `outputs[*].schema` fields are the most important part of eval.yaml. They drive the entire pipeline — agents and judges read them to understand the data.

**Good** — references actual file names, field names, and content:
```
Each case directory contains:
- input.yaml: YAML file with 'prompt' (the problem statement to send
  to the skill) and 'clarifying_context' (additional background).
- reference.md: Gold standard output, a markdown document with
  YAML frontmatter (title, status, priority) and sections for
  Summary, Problem Statement, and Acceptance Criteria.
- annotations.yaml: Expected scores and test metadata.
```

**Bad** — vague, no specific field names:
```
Cases contain input files and reference outputs.
```

The difference: a good schema lets judges write `outputs["main_content"]` knowing what to expect. A bad schema forces them to guess.

### External-State Fields

Some input fields reference resources that must exist in an external system at execution time — Jira project keys, GitHub repo URLs, Slack channel IDs, API endpoints. If eval-dataset doesn't know a field is externally constrained, it will invent plausible but invalid values (e.g., `AGENTREADY` as a Jira project key derived from the repo directory name), causing silent failures at eval-run time.

Mark these fields with `[EXTERNAL: System]` in the schema description:

**Good** — external constraint is explicit:
```text
- input.yaml: YAML file with 'project_key' ([EXTERNAL: Jira] — must be
  a real project key on the target Jira instance, e.g. RHEL or MYPROJECT)
  and 'summary' (free text describing the issue to search for).
```

**Bad** — no indication the value must exist externally:
```text
- input.yaml: YAML file with 'project_key' (Jira project key)
  and 'summary' (issue description).
```

The `[EXTERNAL]` marker tells `/eval-dataset` to generate `TODO_` placeholder values instead of fabricating realistic-looking but invalid data. Users must replace these placeholders with real values before running `/eval-run`.

## Writing Good Judges

**Inline `check` judges** validate structure — things that can be verified deterministically:
- Files exist in the expected directories
- YAML/JSON fields are present and have valid values
- Counts, ranges, and formats are correct

Keep check scripts short (under 15 lines). They receive an `outputs` dict — **always use this dict to access files, never use `os.listdir()` or filesystem paths** (judges run in the project root, not the per-case output directory).

Key fields in `outputs`:
- `outputs["files"]` — dict of `{relative_path: file_content}`, e.g. `{"artifacts/rfe-tasks/RFE-001.md": "# Summary\n..."}`
- `outputs["case_dir"]` — absolute path to the per-case output directory
- `outputs["exit_code"]`, `outputs["duration_s"]`, `outputs["cost_usd"]`, `outputs["num_turns"]` — execution metadata
- `outputs["tool_calls"]` — list of captured tool calls
- `outputs["stdout"]`, `outputs["stderr"]` — captured logs
- `outputs["annotations"]` — parsed `annotations.yaml` from the dataset case directory (always present, empty dict if no file)

Example check judge — find files by path prefix and read their content:
```yaml
  - name: files_exist
    check: |
      files = outputs.get("files", {})
      tasks = [k for k in files if k.startswith("output_dir/") and k.endswith(".md")]
      if not tasks:
          return (False, "No output files found")
      return (True, f"{len(tasks)} files found")

  - name: valid_yaml_header
    check: |
      import yaml
      files = outputs.get("files", {})
      reviews = {k: v for k, v in files.items() if k.endswith("-review.md")}
      for fname, content in reviews.items():
          parts = content.split('---', 2)
          fm = yaml.safe_load(parts[1])
          if 'score' not in fm:
              return (False, f"{fname}: missing score")
      return (True, f"{len(reviews)} reviews valid")
```

**Error handling in check judges:** Use `.get()` with defaults for all dict lookups — if the skill produced no output or failed, keys may be missing. Return `(False, "reason")` for missing data rather than letting exceptions propagate:
```yaml
  - name: has_output
    check: |
      files = outputs.get("files", {})
      if not files:
          return (False, "No output files produced")
      content = list(files.values())[0]
      if len(content.strip()) < 50:
          return (False, f"Output too short ({len(content.strip())} chars)")
      return (True, f"{len(files)} files, {len(content)} chars")
```

**LLM `prompt` judges** assess quality — things that need understanding:
- Completeness: does the output cover all requirements?
- Accuracy: is the content correct?
- Relevance: does it address the input?

**IMPORTANT**: LLM judges only see what's in their prompt text. To include the skill's output files, use the `{{ outputs }}` template variable. The harness replaces it with all collected file contents (from `outputs[*].path` directories), formatted as markdown sections with file paths as headers. Without `{{ outputs }}`, the LLM receives only the raw prompt text and cannot see any output files.

Example:
```yaml
  - name: output_quality
    prompt: |
      Review the following outputs:

      {{ outputs }}

      Score on a 1-5 scale:
      ...
```

Be specific about scoring criteria. "Score 1-5" is too vague. Define what each level means:
```
Score 1: Missing most requirements, major errors
Score 2: Partially addresses the input, significant gaps
Score 3: Covers the basics but lacks depth or has minor errors
Score 4: Good coverage, well-structured, minor issues only
Score 5: Comprehensive, accurate, well-written
```

**How many judges**: aim for 2-4 inline checks + 1-2 LLM judges. Start lean — you can always add more in later iterations. Every judge needs a `description` field explaining what it checks.

**Naming**: use `snake_case` names (e.g., `files_exist`, `output_quality`). These names appear in `thresholds` and in scoring reports — keep them short and descriptive. Make sure threshold keys match judge names exactly.

## The --update Flow

When `--update` is set, preserve everything already in the file. Don't modify existing judges, schemas, thresholds, or permissions. Only add new top-level keys that don't exist yet (e.g., add `outputs` if missing, but don't touch an existing `outputs` section).
