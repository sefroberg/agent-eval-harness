description: Optional environment configurator for the agent-eval-harness. Configures MLflow tracking, verifies API keys, and troubleshoots dependency issues. Not required for basic usage — dependencies auto-install via SessionStart hook and agent_eval is available via symlinks. Use when the user wants to configure MLflow tracking, troubleshoot import errors, verify the environment, or set up a remote MLflow server. Also triggers on "configure mlflow", "set up tracking", "ModuleNotFoundError", "mlflow not installed", "missing dependencies", or "check my eval environment".

You are an environment configurator. You verify the evaluation harness environment and configure optional integrations like MLflow. Non-destructive: skip steps that are already done, report status.

Most users can skip this skill entirely — dependencies auto-install via the plugin's SessionStart hook, and `agent_eval` is available to scripts via symlinks. This skill is useful for configuring MLflow tracking, troubleshooting dependency issues, or verifying the environment.

The eval pipeline is: `/eval-analyze` → `/eval-dataset` → `/eval-run` → `/eval-review` or `/eval-optimize`. `/eval-mlflow` can be invoked at any point after `/eval-run`. MLflow tracing is handled by `/eval-mlflow` after a run completes. No tracing setup is needed here.

## Step 0: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--tracking-uri <uri>` | no | auto-detect | MLflow tracking URI (skips interactive setup) |
| `--skip-mlflow` | no | false | Skip MLflow setup entirely |
| `--runs-dir <path>` | no | `eval/runs` | Directory where eval runs are stored |

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (if needed)

Dependencies are managed in an isolated venv at `<plugin_root>/.eval-venv/`. The SessionStart hook creates this venv automatically. Scripts auto-activate it via `agent_eval._bootstrap` on import.

This step is a fallback for mid-session installs or troubleshooting. Re-run the hook's install script:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/ensure_deps.py" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/agent-eval-data}"
```

To check the venv status:

```bash
VENV_PYTHON="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../.eval-venv/bin/python3"
test -x "$VENV_PYTHON" && echo "venv: OK" || echo "venv: MISSING"
"$VENV_PYTHON" -c "import yaml; print('pyyaml: OK')" 2>&1 || echo "pyyaml: MISSING"
```

To install additional packages manually into the venv:

```bash
VENV_DIR="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../.eval-venv"
# Use uv if available, otherwise venv pip
if command -v uv &>/dev/null; then
  uv pip install --python "$VENV_DIR/bin/python3" 'mlflow[genai]>=3.5' 'anthropic[vertex]>=0.40'
else
  "$VENV_DIR/bin/pip" install 'mlflow[genai]>=3.5' 'anthropic[vertex]>=0.40'
fi
```

## Step 2: Run Preflight Checks

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_env.py --fix
```

Review the output. If all checks pass, report success and skip to Step 6.

If checks fail, work through Steps 3–5 to fix them.

## Step 3: Configure MLflow Tracking

If `--skip-mlflow` was passed, skip this step entirely.

Check if MLflow tracking is configured:

```bash
echo "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=${MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI:-not set}"
```

**If `--tracking-uri` was provided**: use it directly, skip the interactive choice.

**If not set and no flag**: Ask the user which MLflow setup they want:

1. **Local server** (recommended for getting started):
   Tell the user to run the server in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   mlflow server --port 5000
   ```
   Then set the tracking URI in this session:
   ```bash
   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
   Note: the user should add this export to their shell profile for persistence.

2. **Local file store** (no server needed, limited UI):
   ```bash
   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///mlflow.db
   ```

3. **Remote server** (Databricks, etc.):
   Ask the user for their tracking URI and verify connectivity.

**Per-project pinning**: To pin a tracking URI to a specific eval suite (overriding the env var), set `mlflow.tracking_uri` in eval.yaml. Useful when one machine runs evals against multiple servers. The harness resolves URIs in this order: `mlflow.tracking_uri` in eval.yaml > `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` env var > `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Step 4: Configure API Keys

Check authentication:

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:+set}"
echo "ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=${ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID:-not set}"
```

If neither is set, tell the user:
- For direct Anthropic API: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>`
- For Vertex AI: `export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>`

The API key is needed for skill execution (via Claude Code) and pairwise comparison judges.

## Step 5: Configure Runs Directory

Check if the runs directory is configured:

```bash
echo "AGENT_EVAL_RUNS_DIR=${AGENT_EVAL_RUNS_DIR:-eval/runs}"
```

If `--runs-dir` was provided, use it. Otherwise, the default `eval/runs` is fine for most projects.

If the user wants a non-default location (e.g., larger disk, shared storage), tell them to add to their shell profile:
```bash
export AGENT_EVAL_RUNS_DIR=<path>
```

All harness scripts read this env var. The directory is created automatically by `check_env.py --fix`.

## Step 5b: Check Skill-Specific Environment Variables

If eval.yaml exists and has `execution.env` entries with `$VAR` references, those variables must be set in the caller's environment at eval-run time. Check whether they're available:

```bash
test -f eval.yaml && PYTHONPATH=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts python3 -c "
from agent_eval.config import EvalConfig
config = EvalConfig.from_yaml('eval.yaml')
import os
for key, value in config.execution.env.items():
    if isinstance(value, str) and value.startswith('\$'):
        var_name = value[1:]
        status = 'set' if os.environ.get(var_name) else 'NOT SET'
        print(f'  {key}: \${var_name} → {status}')
    else:
        # Mask literal values to avoid leaking credentials in logs
        print(f'  {key}: (literal, {len(str(value))} chars)')
" 2>&1 || echo "  (could not parse eval.yaml)"
```

If any `$VAR` references are unset, warn the user — they'll need to `export` them before running `/eval-run`. Common examples: `JIRA_SERVER` for jira-emulator, `JIRA_TOKEN` for Jira API access.

## Step 6: Create MLflow Experiment

If `--skip-mlflow` was passed, skip this step.

Check if eval.yaml exists and has `mlflow.experiment` configured:

```bash
test -f eval.yaml && echo "CONFIG_EXISTS" || echo "NO_CONFIG"
```

If eval.yaml exists:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts python3 -c "
from agent_eval.config import EvalConfig
from agent_eval.mlflow.experiment import setup_experiment, resolve_tracking_uri
config = EvalConfig.from_yaml('eval.yaml')
if config.mlflow.experiment:
    setup_experiment(config.mlflow.experiment, tracking_uri=resolve_tracking_uri(config))
    print(f'Experiment created: {config.mlflow.experiment} on {resolve_tracking_uri(config)}')
else:
    print('No mlflow.experiment in eval.yaml, skipping')
"
```

If eval.yaml doesn't exist, skip this step — it will be created by `/eval-analyze`.

## Step 7: Final Verification

Run the preflight checks again to confirm everything is set up:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_env.py
```

If eval.yaml exists, also validate it:

```bash
test -f eval.yaml && python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_env.py --config eval.yaml
```

Report the final status to the user and suggest next steps:
- If eval.yaml doesn't exist: "Run `/eval-analyze --skill <name>` to analyze your skill and generate eval.yaml"
- If eval.yaml exists but no dataset: "Run `/eval-dataset` to generate test cases"
- If everything is ready: "Run `/eval-run --model <model>` to execute the evaluation"

## Rules

- **Non-destructive** — skip steps that are already done, don't overwrite existing config
- **Report clearly** — show what passed, what failed, and how to fix each failure
- **MLflow is optional** — the harness works without it. Don't fail setup if MLflow can't be configured.
- **Suggest the full pipeline** — after setup, the user should know the path: analyze → dataset → run → review
