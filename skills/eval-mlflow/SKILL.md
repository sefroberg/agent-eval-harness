description: MLflow integration for evaluation — sync datasets, log run results, push/pull feedback between the harness and MLflow traces. Use when the user wants to log eval results to MLflow, sync test cases to MLflow datasets, connect judge scores to traces, pull MLflow annotations for eval-optimize, or view results in the MLflow UI. Triggers on "log to mlflow", "sync dataset", "push results", "mlflow integration", "view in mlflow".

You are an MLflow integration agent. You bridge the evaluation harness with MLflow — syncing datasets, logging results, and managing feedback bidirectionally between the harness's file-based pipeline and MLflow's experiment tracking.

## Step 0: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--action <action>` | no | `all` | One of: `sync-dataset`, `log-results`, `push-feedback`, `pull-feedback`, `all` |
| `--config <path>` | no | `eval.yaml` | Path to eval config |
| `--run-id <id>` | for log/push/pull | — | Which eval run to log or attach feedback to |

## Step 1: Verify MLflow

Check MLflow is configured:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts python3 -c "
from agent_eval.mlflow.experiment import ensure_server
if ensure_server():
    print('MLflow server: OK')
else:
    print('MLflow server: not reachable')
import os
print(f'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI={os.environ.get(\"MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI\", \"not set\")}')
"
```

If not configured, suggest running `/eval-setup` first. The scripts resolve the tracking URI from `mlflow.tracking_uri` in eval.yaml first, then `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` env var, then default to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. If the server is unreachable but a remote URI is set, proceed — the scripts handle connectivity errors gracefully.

## Step 2: Read Configuration

Read eval.yaml to understand:
- `mlflow.experiment` — the experiment name
- `dataset.path` and `dataset.schema` — where cases are and what they look like
- `judges` — what was scored (for feedback context)

## Step 3: Sync Dataset (if `--action sync-dataset` or `all`)

This is a two-phase process: you interpret the schema, then a script syncs deterministically.

### Step 3a: Read schema and sample case

Read `dataset.schema` from eval.yaml. Then browse one case directory at `dataset.path`:

```bash
ls <dataset_path>/ | head -5
```

Read the first case directory to see what files exist and their structure.

### Step 3b: Produce schema mapping

Based on your understanding of `dataset.schema` and the sample case, create `tmp/schema_mapping.json`. This maps MLflow record fields to source files and field paths:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "<field_name>": "<filename>:<field_path_or___file__>"
  },
  "expectations": {
    "<field_name>": "<filename>:<field_path_or___file__>"
  }
}
```

**Rules for the mapping:**
- `"input.yaml:prompt"` → extract the `prompt` field from `input.yaml`
- `"input.yaml:context.details"` → extract nested field `context.details`
- `"reference.md:__file__"` → use the entire file content as the value
- **inputs**: fields the skill receives as input (prompts, context, parameters)
- **expectations**: reference/gold outputs the skill should produce (reference docs, expected scores)

Write the mapping:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp
cat > tmp/schema_mapping.json << 'EOF'
<your mapping here>
EOF
```

### Step 3c: Run sync

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sync_dataset.py \
  --config <config> \
  --mapping tmp/schema_mapping.json
```

The script validates the mapping against the first case and prints a preview before syncing. If the preview looks wrong, adjust the mapping and re-run.

## Step 4: Log Run Results (if `--action log-results` or `all`)

Requires `--run-id`. Logs params, metrics, artifacts, and per-case results table to an MLflow run.

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log_results.py \
  --run-id <id> \
  --config <config>
```

This logs:
- **Params**: skill, runner.type, model, run_id
- **Metrics**: per-judge mean and pass_rate, execution metrics (duration, cost, turns), per-model cost/token breakdown
- **Artifacts**: summary.yaml
- **Table**: per-case results with case_id, judge, value, rationale
- **Traces**: one per case (case mode) or one for the run (batch mode), built from stdout.log
- **Tags**: regressions_detected (yes/no), num_judges, plus any `mlflow.tags` from eval.yaml

## Step 5: Push Feedback (if `--action push-feedback` or `all`)

Requires `--run-id`. Finds execution traces and attaches judge + human feedback.

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/attach_feedback.py \
  --run-id <id> \
  --config <config> \
  --source all
```

This pushes:
- **Judge feedback** (from `summary.yaml`): `source_type=CODE`, named `{case_id}/{judge_name}`
- **Human feedback** (from `review.yaml`, if it exists): `source_type=HUMAN`, named `{case_id}/human_review`

If no traces are found (tracing not enabled), the script reports 0 and succeeds — tracing is optional.

## Step 6: Pull Feedback (if `--action pull-feedback`)

Requires `--run-id`. Pulls annotations added via the MLflow UI back into `review.yaml` for `/eval-optimize` to consume.

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/attach_feedback.py \
  --run-id <id> \
  --config <config> \
  --action pull
```

Pulled annotations are saved to `review.yaml` under the `mlflow_feedback` section, separate from local human feedback. `/eval-optimize` reads both.

## Step 7: Report

Print summary:
- **Dataset**: synced N cases to MLflow dataset `<name>` (if sync ran)
- **Results**: logged to experiment `<name>`, run `<run_id>` (if log ran)
- **Feedback**: pushed N entries to M traces (if push ran)
- **Pulled**: N annotations from MLflow UI (if pull ran)
- **MLflow UI**: `$MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`

Suggest next steps (include `--config <config>` if a non-default config was used):
- `/eval-review --run-id <id>` for human review
- `/eval-optimize --model <model>` for automated improvement
- View results in MLflow UI at the tracking URI

## Rules

- **Read the schema** — understand `dataset.schema` to build the mapping correctly. The mapping is the critical step — everything downstream depends on it.
- **No hardcoded fields** — determine inputs vs expectations by reading the schema descriptions, not by assuming field names.
- **Graceful degradation** — if MLflow is not available, scripts exit 0 and the skill reports "MLflow not available, skipping."
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times. `merge_records` deduplicates, `log_feedback` overwrites.
- **Don't block on traces** — trace feedback is optional. If no traces exist, skip and note that tracing is configured automatically by `/eval-run`.
